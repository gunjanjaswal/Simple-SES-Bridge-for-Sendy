## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Scheduled Campaigns Not Sending on Time?

**Why:** WordPress uses WP-Cron, which only triggers when someone visits your site. Low-traffic sites may experience delays.

**Automatic Recovery:**
- The plugin **automatically detects and sends** overdue campaigns when you visit the Campaigns page
- You'll see a green success notice: *"Overdue Campaign Sent: [Campaign Name] was automatically sent."*
- If auto-send fails, you'll see the error message with a **"Retry Send"** button

**Permanent Solution (Recommended for Production):**

1. **Disable WP-Cron** by adding this to `wp-config.php`:
   ```php
   define('DISABLE_WP_CRON', true);
   ```

2. **Set up a real cron job** (via cPanel, Plesk, or server SSH):
   ```bash
   * * * * * wget -q -O - https://yourdomain.com/wp-cron.php?doing_wp_cron >/dev/null 2>&1
   ```
   
   Or using `curl`:
   ```bash
   * * * * * curl https://yourdomain.com/wp-cron.php?doing_wp_cron >/dev/null 2>&1
   ```

### Campaign Failed to Send?

Failed campaigns will display:
- ❌ Red error notice at the top of the Campaigns page
- 📋 Exact error message in the "Error" column
- 🔄 **"Retry Send"** button for instant retry

**Common Errors:**
- **"Reply to email not passed"** - Fixed automatically in v1.0.0+
- **"Invalid API key"** - Check your Sendy settings
- **"List ID is required"** - Verify your default list ID in settings

### Campaign Stuck at "Preparing to send..." in Sendy?

**Why:** Sendy requires its own cron job to process and send campaigns. Without it, campaigns get queued but never send.

**Quick Fix (Manual Trigger):**
```
https://your-sendy-domain.com/scheduled.php?i=1
```
Replace `your-sendy-domain.com` with your actual Sendy URL. This manually triggers campaign processing.

**Permanent Fix (Set Up Sendy Cron):**

Add this cron job to your server:

**Via cPanel:**
1. Go to **cPanel > Cron Jobs**
2. Set to run every 5 minutes: `*/5 * * * *`
3. Command:
   ```bash
   php /home/yourusername/public_html/sendy/scheduled.php > /dev/null 2>&1
   ```

**Via SSH:**
```bash
crontab -e
```
Add this line:
```bash
*/5 * * * * php /path/to/sendy/scheduled.php > /dev/null 2>&1
```

This automatically processes queued campaigns every 5 minutes.
